Recently discovered cave (May 2023), has many sets of alligator bones laid out perfectly within Sand Dollar. Beautiful sinkhole, several thousand feet of line, with [upstream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUTQwptDRN0) being the more going passageway. Downstream side goes through a sidemount restriction and into a huge breakdown room with many different ways to go. Mung sink is nearby, and contained a juvenile alligator. No connection has been made between the two yet. Sand Dollar requires a ladder to climb out of, ropes to lower/raise tanks. Sidemount cave. Mung has about 300ft of penetration and is a good-sized cavern. Both go down to ~90ft at the deepest so far.
