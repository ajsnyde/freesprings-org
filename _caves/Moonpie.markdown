Cameron had a lead. A landowner. And permission. He also got his first virgin cave earlier that week (Mudbug), so it was even more exciting when we found a crackling blue pool in either side of the crescent-moon shaped depression. Not just a depression, a cliffside, practically. After inspecting some nearby and not-so-promising sinks with the guidance of the landowner, a plan was made. Cameron would take the more likely and deeper side of the sink, and I’d poke around the shallow section, no tanks. Just poke my head a couple feet below with a mask on to see if there was anything worthy. I’d join him shortly after. My side was as expected. Clear blue, with a clear connection, but definitely some gnarly no-mount stuff. No dice. So I hopped out, made my way to the Cam’s side, waded in, and kitted up. As I’m doing so, I was careful to minimize the amount of silt and mud kicked up. After dropping down a few feet to meet Cameron, he circled a small hole in the otherwise impenetrable breakdown area. I didn’t understand. The last thing on my mind was the idea that he wanted me to go in. This was his. After repeating and confirming, I gingerly squeezed into the little person-sized slot. We were diving sidemount, but it was still rock-to-rock on my body as I shimmied in. 

I would have been stunned if I weren’t so focused on making my way through the restriction - a modestly-sized room with silt covering literally every inch. Not a line in sight. Tunnel going left, more so going right! Virgin cave! The reel handed to me, up until now for safety, now had a higher purpose. True exploration. Going to the more encouraging right side, making wraps, and being as delicate as one can be when surrounded by such an untouched environment - what a thrill! I followed the tunnel another 70 or so feet before hitting a T in the tunnel and tying off. In hindsight, it was a mistake cutting the line, but I could hardly think about that kind of detail. I had to get back to Cameron and get him down there. When I got back to the restriction, I must have been pretty obvious in my excitement. He handed me some wetnotes - Does it go? Yes! I answered a few more questions, and was about to back through the restriction again, when he pretty much blocked me. I was hoping to celebrate on the surface with him before coming up with a bit more of a game plan. Nope, he wanted to check it out immediately, and I couldn’t blame him. After getting through, he followed my short line, reached the end, and poked around in a couple directions before removing my cookie at the end and replacing it with his own. Warranted, I guess, but a little dissapointing until I saw that he had made a cookie in advance with both our names and the year on it. I beamed. On the way out, he surveyed.

Sadly that might have been our first and last venture into Moonpie. One of the owner’s relatives was a lawyer, and I guess when your job involves a fair amount of ridiculous lawsuits, any exposure is too much exposure. No fault was made on our end, just gun-shy family members.
