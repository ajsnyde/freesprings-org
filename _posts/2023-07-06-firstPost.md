Welcome! The FreeSprings Project was an idea I had nearly a year ago, when browsing through [caveatlas.com](http://www.caveatlas.com/). It's a terrific tool, but most of the maps simply aren't available in decent quality, and the overall interface isn't easy to contribute to, so it's not going to really improve. As a software developer, one of my primary joys in life is to take something normally difficult/exhaustive and _lower the barrier to entry_ for others. That's why I created this site the way I did. The process to contribute is fairly straightforward:

If you want to add a cave (let's say it's called Shek Sink), you'll need to create a single file: `ShekSink.md` [here](https://github.com/ajsnyde/freesprings-org)
